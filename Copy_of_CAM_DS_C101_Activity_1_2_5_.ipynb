        "As you know, **Communik8** has experienced a reduction in both new and existing customers. The Head of Sales has suggested that an analysis of customer behaviour might provide insight into the reason(s) why. To this end, the company has provided you with a list of metrics, or features, from its data to help identify factors influencing customer behaviour. Think about your own experiences as a customer and what factors might influence how, what, and when you purchase something from a vendor. For example:\n",
        "- Customer age\n",
        "- Purchase amount\n",
        "- Location\n",
        "- Loyalty membership\n",
        "- Conversion rate\n",
        "- Gender\n",
        "- Products purchased\n",
        "- Website traffic\n",
        "- Average shipping time\n",
        "- Gross profit margin\n",
        "- Repeat purchase rate\n",
        "- Cart abandonment rate\n",
        "- Inventory turnover rate\n",
        "- Customer support response time\n",
        "- Customer satisfaction score\n",

        "- Reflect on and identify five to seven features that you think will provide the best insights into customer behaviour.\n",

        "My process for selecting these features was to reflect on the customer feedback seen earlier. I wanted to choose metrics that could provide hard data. Customer Satisfaction Score is a direct and powerful metric for gauging how happy customers are. A low satisfaction score is often the first signal of a problem and is a strong predictor of customer churn.\n",
        "\n",
        "Customer Support Response Time is also critical because it directly measures a key pain point that was highlighted in the customer feedback: delays in getting help. Long response times can lead to significant customer frustration, which can in turn lead to contract cancellations. Analyzing this metric will help us quantify the efficiency of the support team and its impact on retention.\n",
        "\n",
        "For a telecommunications company, location is a vital feature. It allows us to perform geographical analysis. By correlating customer location with metrics like customer satisfaction scores and network coverage complaints, we can identify specific areas where service is inadequate.\n",
        "\n",
        "Average shipping time is a crucial metric for the delivery theme identified in customer feedback. It directly measures whether the company is meeting its delivery promises. Long shipping times can lead to order cancellations and a negative customer experience, which impacts both new customer acquisition and overall satisfaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally repeat purchase rate directly reflects customer loyalty and retention. Since the company is experiencing a decline in existing customers, analyzing the repeat purchase rate will provide a clear, data-driven look into the severity of this problem\n",
